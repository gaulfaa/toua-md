# Town Of Us Amplified v1.0.0
First release! Thank you for using TOUA!
## **Role Improvements**
* Haunter was scrapped (buggy and hard to combat)
* Medium can have multiple ghost watching strategies, one of them using Mystic's ability
* Mystic's buffed to have a longer arrow time when tasks are done
* Trapper actually traps the killers now!
* Vigilante Buff + turn into modifier
* Jailor Change (Inspo from TOUE!)
* Prosecutor does nothing inround and just an excuse to gamethrow in meeting
* Altruist reworked to actually 'sacrifice themselves' to save another Crew
* Cleric given Medic's abilities, Medic was removed (this may be reverted)
* Engineer actually has to fix the sabotages now!
* Eclipsal-Grenadier cannot co-exist (their ability are  merged, however this may be reverted)
* Soul Collector name change to Reaper. Soul Collector is changed to be a member of the Apocalyptic faction (see below)

## **New Factions!**
### **The Apocalyptic Faction**
Instead of there having only Plaguebearer transforming into Horseman of the Apocalypse (Pestilence), there are now multiple roles that can do so!
* Plaguebearer - Infect everyone with the Plague to become Pestilence
* Berserker - Get enough kills to become Pestilence
* Soul Collector - Put reap marks on players, collecting their souls to become Pestilence

More may be to come, but that's it for now! Obviously these roles cannot co-exist together, and Berserker can't co-exist with Juggernaut.


### **The Coven Faction**
This is only useful for Crowded players, but there's a new faction! Impostors, but they have extra witchy abilities!\
The Coven have the goal to eliminate everybody opposing their team, gaining majority.
* Witch - A default role of the member of the Coven (similar to Crewmate from the crewmate faction)
* Coven Leader - Retrain fellow Coven members!
* Illutionist - Sell the illusion to Investigatives, then victimize someone. If the Investigatives are to find out a witch is evil, they will see the victimized person as evil instead.
* Medusa - Stone players and wait for their death to unlock ability/team perks!
* Potionist - Use your potions to help the team!
* Conjurer - Kill and drop meteors!
* Voodoo Master - Manipulate a voodoo doll made out of someone like a puppet!

After every round, a book (in the modifiers section) will be given to one of the witches in the Coven, in which the spawn chances are suitable. The book gives the Witch more abilities!
