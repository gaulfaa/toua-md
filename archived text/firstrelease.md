# Town Of Us Amplified v0.0.1
First pre-release! Please test it out and report bugs in the Discord.

Thank you for using TOUA!
## Role Changes
* Altruist Removed
* Forensic (Detective) reworked into Coroner (TOS2)
* Haunter Removed
* Investigator Footprint Role Removed
* Lookout Reworked
* Snitch Removed
* Trapper Reworked to actually Trap!
* Deputy Extra Ability
* Hunter Removed
* Vigilante Removed
* Swapper Removed
* Oracle Removed
* Transporter Reworked
* Medium can have multiple ghost watching strategies, one of them using Mystic's ability
* Jailor Change (Inspo from TOUE!)
* Prosecutor does nothing inround and just an excuse to gamethrow in meeting. For that, it is removed.
* Engineer actually has to fix the sabotages now!
* Traitor keeps their roles and abilities, however they may change their role to an Impostor. They can be guessed as their original Crewmate role, the role they have chosen as an Impsotor, or as "Traitor".
* Blackmailer now has a red-blue pill situation
* Eclipsal-Grenadier cannot co-exist (their ability are  merged, however this may be reverted)

## **New Factions!**
### **The Apocalyptic Faction**
Instead of there having only Plaguebearer transforming into Horseman of the Apocalypse (Pestilence), there are now multiple roles that can do so!
* Plaguebearer - Infect everyone with the Plague to become Pestilence
* Berserker - Get enough kills to become Pestilence
* Soul Collector - Put reap marks on players, collecting their souls to become Pestilence

More may be to come, but that's it for now! Obviously these roles cannot co-exist together, and Berserker can't co-exist with Juggernaut.


### **The Coven Faction**
This is only useful for Crowded players, but there's a new faction! Impostors, but they have extra witchy abilities!\
The Coven have the goal to eliminate everybody opposing their team, gaining majority.
* Witch - A default role of the member of the Coven (similar to Crewmate from the crewmate faction)
* Coven Leader - Retrain fellow Coven members!
* Illutionist - Sell the illusion to Investigatives, then victimize someone. If the Investigatives are to find out a witch is evil, they will see the victimized person as evil instead.
* Medusa - Stone players and wait for their death to unlock ability/team perks!
* Potionist - Use your potions to help the team!
* Conjurer - Kill and drop meteors!
* Voodoo Master - Manipulate a voodoo doll made out of someone like a puppet!

After every round, a book (in the modifiers section) will be given to one of the witches in the Coven, in which the spawn chances are suitable. The book gives the Witch more abilities!
