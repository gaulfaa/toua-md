> Evil Guessers take away the fun from Social Deduction Games (SDGs). The meetings in the game are extremely dull. The only thing you could say was "oh I was here", "no I was there", "she was there" etc etc. You can't even share your information as an Investigative anymore. Do they just keep their information to themselves?
> 
> The worst offender is Detective or even Seer. Examine red, it flashes green. Examine blue, it flashes red. Instincts would make you call a meeting or something, but saying your information means players won't be able to know if purple is green or red. Because I've seen people saying "I think Red may have killed Green" and getting guessed as Detective later. See what I mean?
> 
> Players can't tell their information without the constant fear of death because LITERALLY EVERY KILLER COULD GUESS. 4 players (2 NKs and 2 Imps) who could kill you when you say ANYTHING about your role. Throw in Doomsayer, that makes it 5.
>
> Now, yes, I know why Assassin exists. It attempts to fix the role-claiming issue. I mean, it works as a bandaid issue because there are SO MANY instant-claim Crewmates by publicly doing something other roles can't. Role-claiming (or alignment claiming) was an issue because every role was unique. Now, you can make a role have multiple players. What does Assassin even do anymore??
>
> The whole point of Investigatives is to collect & give information. 
There is a problem: I get info! If I say it, I get guessed (killed), so I don't say it. So either the evil team wins and you get called out for having information and not sharing it OR you say it and get killed.
> 
> This results in meetings being just "where?", "yeah I was here", "no you were there" and not sharing anything related to your role. Because again, you get killed for sharing any information even hinting at a role.
> 
> I know “7 is evil my role says so” exists, but you can so easily deduct what their role is. For example, LO is turned off. Then, this person camps areas very often. Detective, Spy, Tracker cannot exactly give this correct information. Which leaves Trapper. There is always a fear with sharing your information, and adding in the fact they could get killed via 2 mouse clicks isn’t the best idea.
>
> I also know this would hard clear people, but I want to let you know Executioner exists, and literally anyone could fake Trapper info and say “I made a trap in cafe no evil roles were in it” or “6 was interacted by BM and Arso” is also fakeable if you’re Arso and they’re BMd. Or just make shit up for dead players. Roles aren’t even unique anymore. If someone does manage to CC you, how would anyone confirm them exactly? Oh that’s right. Via the Investigatives that can get killed via 2 buttons.
>
> If you still don’t get it, let’s play a game, it’s called “who would you vote”
Jake claims Mary is a killer. Their teammates say it’s a “glorph” (Morphling/Glitch).
Jane claims Trapper and Lilly is the Ambusher.
Some would also say, 1 Crew for 1 Evil is OK. Not if the evil is about to get the majority and force skips it. Or it is the final 4 or 5 and there are still 2 evils remaining.
> 
> Our solution: it's a role again as Impostor Concealing (Assassin) in the Impostor faction and a Coven Power (Ritualist) in the Coven faction. Just try one game w/o Assassin and see how much less dull it is during meetings.
> 
> **TL;DR: Assassin sucks, we made it a role again, guessing Crew Investigatives is now discouraged and an obscure setting. You can re-make it an ability.**
