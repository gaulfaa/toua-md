# Contributing
Thank you for wanting to contribute to TOUA! When contributing, please make PRs in the dev branch.\
Allowed:
- setting & UI changes\
  We love QoL changes! This includes suggestions like: "instead of having 2 chatboxes, make the other one available by clicking in a special button in the first chatbox"

- role improvements (not new roles!)\
  This include suggestions like: "Seer should get a nerf, it's way too powerful [...]". This does not include "add this new role"


Disallowed:
- role and modifier suggestions\
  We believe that most mods are going quantity over quality. We want to make sure every role is perfect before rolling out new ones. Therefore, we do not accept new role/mod suggestions at this time
  
- Copying other suggestions / duplicate suggestions\
  If you want to add to another suggestion, just comment on it. Note: do not comment things like "i love this!", "add this!", or the worst of all, "bump". If you want something added, react with a üëç. Only comment if you have something to add.

- Roles from other mods\
  Allowed if you credit wherever credit is due.\
  Speaking of credit...
