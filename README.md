# Town Of Us Amplified
An Among Us mod based on Town Of Salem.
> **This is a rewrite of Town Of Us Mira. Expect bugs!!!**
> This mod is not for console versions of Among Us and is not host only either.

>  Big thank you to [Detective & Xmorph](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1It4-qedaFqSCWVu7A9kHNbzO9DgdBxFB_o9XvKG4aNo/edit?usp=sharing) for most of the information in this rant.

> Evil Guessers take away the fun from Social Deduction Games (SDGs).
> What do you mean saying literally ANYTHING about your role means you die? What is the fun in that??

> This makes the meetings in the game extremely dull. The only thing you could say was "oh I was here", "no I was there", "she was there" etc etc. You can't even share your information as an Investigative anymore. Do they just keep their information to themselves?\
> The worst offender is Detective or even Seer. Examine red, it flashes green. Examine blue, it flashes red. Instincts would make you call a meeting or something, but saying your information means players won't be able to know if purple is green or red. Because I've seen people saying "I think Red may have killed Green" and getting guessed as Detective later. See what I mean?
> 
> Players can't tell their information without the constant fear of death because LITERALLY EVERY KILLER COULD GUESS. 4 players (2 NKs and 2 Imps) who could kill you when you say ANYTHING about your role. Throw in Doomsayer, that makes it 5.

> Now, yes, I know why Assassin exists. It attempts to fix the role-claiming issue. I mean, it works as a bandaid issue because there are SO MANY instant-claim Crewmates by publicly doing something other roles can't. Role-claiming (or alignment claiming) was an issue because every role was unique. Now, you can make a role have multiple players. What does Assassin even do anymore??
>
> Our solution in the mod: it's a role again as an Imp Concealing! There's also some configuration for guessing Investigatives. Of course, if you want every killer to guess, you can toggle the setting in Assassin. Just try one game w/o Assassin and see how much less dull it is during meetings.
