<summary> Why should I switch from my mods to TOUA? </summary>

- There aren't any annoying welcome or long messages when you join a lobby. However requesting the last game summary or help can be one command away!
- TOUA contains almost all the roles from different mods (such as TOHE, TOUR/M), so you won't be missing out on anything. Some roles were deleted or modified to be more balanced with your gameplay experience in mind.
- Most mods have roles just to bloat it by adding an extra line to the role list. TOUA has only high-quality roles that provide actual information, or help the team.
- If some words (such as discriminatory content or people spamming “start”) isn’t your cup of tea, there is a built-in automod system!
- TOUA helps everyone use commands by displaying their short descriptions below the chatbox and their argument(s).
- TOUA remixes many mods’s ideas and adds more ideas into them. For example, the Natural Disasters and Quiz game modes in the EHR mod were reworked to the Hunger Games. It goes in-depth more than ND/Quiz, while still keeping the original idea.
- If this list wasn't convincing, you can always try TOUA and see if you like it better than the mods you already downloaded. Whatever you do, I respect your decision.
