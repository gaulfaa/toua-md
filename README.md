# Town Of Us Amplified
This is an Among Us mod based on [Town Of Salem](https://www.townofsalem.io/), a rewrite of TOU Mira based on [community feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1It4-qedaFqSCWVu7A9kHNbzO9DgdBxFB_o9XvKG4aNo/edit?usp=sharing). Expect bugs!!!\
Big shoutout to `Det & Xmorph` for most of the modifications & improvements in the mod!

> Evil Guessers take away the fun from Social Deduction Games (SDGs). The meetings in the game are extremely dull. The only thing you could say was "oh I was here", "no I was there", "she was there" etc etc. You can't even share your information as an Investigative anymore. Do they just keep their information to themselves?
> 
> The worst offender is Detective or even Seer. Examine red, it flashes green. Examine blue, it flashes red. Instincts would make you call a meeting or something, but saying your information means players won't be able to know if purple is green or red. Because I've seen people saying "I think Red may have killed Green" and getting guessed as Detective later. See what I mean?
> 
> Players can't tell their information without the constant fear of death because LITERALLY EVERY KILLER COULD GUESS. 4 players (2 NKs and 2 Imps) who could kill you when you say ANYTHING about your role. Throw in Doomsayer, that makes it 5.
>
> Now, yes, I know why Assassin exists. It attempts to fix the role-claiming issue. I mean, it works as a bandaid issue because there are SO MANY instant-claim Crewmates by publicly doing something other roles can't. Role-claiming (or alignment claiming) was an issue because every role was unique. Now, you can make a role have multiple players. What does Assassin even do anymore??
>
> Our solution in the mod: it's a role again as an Imp Concealing! There's also some configuration for guessing Investigatives. Of course, if you want every killer to guess, you can toggle the setting in Assassin. Just try one game w/o Assassin and see how much less dull it is during meetings.

<summary> Why should I switch from my mods to TOUA? </summary>
- TOUA has custom “sweaty” or “chill” (or anything in between) presets and gamemodes, whichever one speaks to you and your friends.
There are no annoying welcome or long messages when you join a lobby. However requesting the last game summary or help can be one command away!
TOUA contains almost all the roles from diverse mods (such as TOHE, TOUR/M), so you won't be missing out on anything. Some roles were deleted or modified to be more balanced with your gameplay experience in mind.
Experimental builds are available for free in our Discord, where you will also be able to report bugs and suggest ideas. Our staff will be happy to assist you.
If some words (such as discriminatory content or people spamming “start”) isn’t your cup of tea, there is a built-in automod system!
TOUA helps everyone use commands by displaying their short descriptions below the chatbox and their argument(s).
There’s always something to keep you occupied. If it’s a loading screen, we always have tips and tricks or fun facts.
TOUA remixes EHR’s ideas and adds more ideas into them. 
For example, the Natural Disasters and Quiz game modes were reworked to the Hunger Games, which goes in-depth more than ND/Quiz, while still keeping the original idea.
I, project lead of TOUA, genuinely care about feedback and suggestions. Don’t hesitate to ask questions or feedback if you need support.
If this list wasn't convincing, you can always try TOUA and see if you like it better than the mods you already downloaded. Whatever you do, I respect your decision.
